By accessing or using our mobile application, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.


## 1. Information We Collect and Use


**A. Microphone Usage**

Our app requires access to your device's microphone to enable the core "Vortex" interaction feature (e.g., analyzing sound levels to trigger visual effects).

**Processing:** All audio data is processed locally on your device in real-time.

**Storage:** We do not record, save, store, or transmit any audio data to external servers.

The data is ephemeral and is discarded immediately after processing.

We use Google AdMob to display advertisements in our app. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads. This data may include:

* IP address
* Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)
* Usage data and interactions with ads

For more information on how Google uses detailed data, please visit Google's Privacy & Terms.


**C. In-App Purchases**

We offer virtual goods (Tokens) for purchase via the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.

**Transactions:** Financial transactions are handled entirely by the respective app store platforms. We do not process or store your credit card or banking information.

**Purchase History:** We may retain a local record of your purchases to unlock features or update your token balance within the app.


**D. Local Storage**

We use local storage on your device (e.g., Shared Preferences) to save your:

* App settings (e.g., sound preferences, theme)
* Game progress (e.g., token balance)

This data is stored only on your device and is not synced to a server.


## 2. Sharing of Your Information

We do not share your personal data with third parties, except as described in this policy:

**Service Providers:** We use third-party services like Google AdMob (for ads). These providers have access to data necessary to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

**Compliance with Laws:** We may disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena.


## 3. Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13. The Service and its content are not directed at children under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.


## 4. Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may modify or update our Privacy Policy from time to time, so please review it periodically.
